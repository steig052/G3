This is a senior design project repository created by Mattthew Steigauf, Tran Lu, Anastasiya Matrosava, Jakob Osterberg, and Maria Puff. It contains main setions. The first is code for a custom made glove controller which emulates a bluetooth keyboard and contrains 5 flex sensors and 2 force sensors. The second is a Unity project which is a digitized Revised Upper Limb Module. Not sure the rights for ussage of the Unity assests but they were all free and credited inside the final application.
The file structure is a bit messy in the Unity porject as this is just our working file set and not some polished project.
The Glove code contains it's own readme for more details on opperation.
